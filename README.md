# ShareSpace

An app for simple sharing of information between people.

Created because I wanted to play with Rails' new web socket implementation, Action Cable

Supports public and private rooms. Private rooms are password protected. All passwords are hashed and salted securely.

The app supports the following message types:

- Text
- Image
- Camera
- Video
- Syntax Highlighting(using ```)
- File upload
